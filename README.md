2. Select a dataset of your own choosing (or select my modified version of SPARCS - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hantswilliams/HHA-507-2022/main/autoML/datasets/data_sparcs.csv) 

# experiment 1 - Binary
3. Create two 'experiments' using the autoML package mljar-supervised 
One that is focused around classification (binary or multi-class outcome variable)
- Describe the two dependent variables (outcomes) for experiment 1 and experiment 2 
    - Describe for each experiment: 
        - What was the best performing model (please interpret (a) log-loss or RMSE between models, and (b) AUC) 
        - How much better (? if any) did the model perform compared to baseline

# experiment 2 - 
One that is focused around regression (continuous outcome variable) 
- Describe the two dependent variables (outcomes) for experiment 1 and experiment 2 
    - Describe for each experiment: 
        - What was the best performing model (please interpret (a) log-loss or RMSE between models, and (b) AUC) 
        - How much better (? if any) did the model perform compared to baseline



4. Include the output of the mljar-supervised output folder inside of the github repo (e.g., so there should be 2 folders - one for classification and one for regression)
